### See https://no-im-bk.github.io/XR-Physics/ to see examples of this code in action.

This repo is a static site that contains code I am writing for a physics engine in javascript.
I am using this textbook as a resource for building this physics engine: (https://gamephysicsweekend.github.io/)[https://gamephysicsweekend.github.io/]
